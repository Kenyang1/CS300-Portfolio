CS300 Reflection

1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Developing a course of management system that effectively arranges and shows course data was my responsibility in this course. Finding and precisely depicting the data structures to get information from the CSV files presented another difficulty in this course. Design and implementation of data structures to enable quick retrieval, insertion, and sorting of naturally occurring data was a difficulty. While Project Two needed code to sort and output a list of courses in alphabetic order, Project One concentrated on examining the runtime and memory use of several data structures.

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To find the greatest fit for the needs of the project, I started by assessing several data structuresâ€”vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. Because a binary search tree (BST) provides effective search, insertion, and deletion operations and because its in-order traversal organically generates a sorted list of courses, I chose one. This initiative underlined the need of knowing data structures in order to maximize resource control and performance in software development.

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Dynamic memory management presented problems, and maintaining the BST's balance for best performance proved difficult. I tested extensively across several datasets, applied debugging tools to uncover problems, and gradually improved my algorithms to get beyond these challenges. Resolving these obstacles also depended critically on getting comments and consulting pertinent material.

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project enlarged my approach by stressing the need of choosing suitable data structures depending on particular challenge requirements. It helped me to create scalable and flexible solutions as well as to take runtime and memory economy into account. The knowledge has motivated me to organize my software design more strategically and to divide difficult challenges into doable sections.

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This assignment has helped me to see the need of producing neat, thoroughly recorded code. These days, I give code organization, good comments, and modular architecture top priority so that my projects are easy to update and maintain. The iterative process of testing and coding improvement has also helped me to generate flexible and strong software solutions.
